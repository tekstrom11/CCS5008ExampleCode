# CS 5008 - Example Code

This repository contains example code used in the videos created for the canvas shell. 


It is highly recommended you create your own fork of this repo. If you look at the top
right of the repo, you will see the 'fork' button. You can then create a local 
copy on your own github. You will then want to clone that local copy to your 
computer, so you can work with the starter code each week. 

This is still in progress, so you will also need to sync the fork, but we will
post an announcement when you need to do that.
